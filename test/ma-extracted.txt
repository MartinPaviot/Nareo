Introduction
M&A
§ Acquisitions or takeovers includes different
transactions
§ Merger (F) Introduction
§ Consolidation
§ Tender Offer (H)
§ Acquisition of assets
§ Buyout M&A
Basic Concepts § Acquisition premium vs. Goodwill
§ Friendly vs. Hostile acquisition
§ Merger activity in the United States, UK and Continental
Europe has occurred in waves
§ Neoclassical hypothesis (PEST and Q - theory)
§ Behavioral hypothesis
§ Reducing costs or increasing market power
§ Strategic realignment
§ Technological change Introduction
§ Deregulation
§ Synergy
§ Economies of scale/scope
§ Cross - selling
M&A
§ Diversification (Related/Unrelated)
Motives
§ Financial considerations
§ Booming stock market
§ Falling interest rates
§ Tax considerations
§ Agency problems
§ Ego/Hubris
§ Empirical studies using event - study methodology
§ The evidence indicates that the stockholders of target
firms are the clear winners in takeovers
Introduction § These gains are much larger in TO (hostile) than in
mergers (friendly)
§ The effect of takeover announcements on bidder firm
stock prices is not as clear cut
M&A § Studies indicate that approximately half of all bidding
firms earn negative excess returns around the Successful or failed transactions?
announcement date
§ Since acquirers are substantially larger than targets, the
above results translate to small positive overall gains
§ In the long run, acquirers in mergers suffer wealth losses,
significant in many studies, but in tender offers they earn
insignificantly positive returns in many studies
§ Results are similar to US, UK and Europe
Introduction
§ Positive abnormal returns to bidders is associated to
the following situations:
§ Target is a private firm or a subsidiary of another firm
M&A § The acquirer is relatively small
Successful when … § The target is small relative to the acquirer
§ Cash rather than equity is used to finance the transaction
§ Transaction occurs early in the M&A cycle
Introduction
§ Primary reasons some M&As fail to meet expectations
§ Overpayment
§ Agency conflicts of the acquirer
M&A § Over - estimating synergy because of hubris
Failure … § Winner’s curse when multiple bidders
§ Slow pace of integration
§ Poor strategy
§ Coherent acquisition strategy has to be based on one or
more of these motives
Value Creation and Strategy § Create operating or financial synergy (synergy value)
§ V(AB) > V( A ) + V( B )
§ Take over poorly managed firms and change
management (control value)
M&A § In the last two decades, has been increasingly cited as a
reason for hostile acquisitions Sources of value
§ Diversify to reduce risk
§ Open question whether it can be accomplished more
efficiently by investors (through traded stocks) or by firms
§ Acquire undervalued firms
§ Very difficult strategy especially when acquiring publicly
traded firms in reasonably efficient markets
Valuation § 1. Status quo valuation of the firm (“as it is”)
§ Value the target firm by estimating the firm value with
existing investing, financing and dividend policies
§ 2. Control value
M&A § The value of controlling a firm comes from changes made
3 steps in value the acquisition to existing management policy that can increase the firm
value (”as it should be”) of a firm
§ Value of Control = Value of firm, optimally managed (“as
it should be”) – Value of firm with current management
(“as it is”)
§ 3. Synergy value
§ Value the firms involved in the merger independently
(target firm, optimally managed, i.e., “as it should be”)
Valuation
§ Estimate the value of the combined firm with no synergy,
V(A) + V(B)
§ Build in the effects of synergy into expected growth rates
and cash flows, and value the combined firm with: V(AB)
M&A
§ V(AB) – [V(A)+V(B)]
3 steps in value the acquisition § In the case the two firms (acquirer and target) are
of a firm managed independently after the acquisition you only
need to estimate the value of the target firm
§ However, in the valuation of the target firm, optimally
managed, should be included any proceeds resulting
from the sale of non - operating assets and the savings due
to redundancy costs.

§ The forecast assumes the following values :
§ Actual (2017) sales = 1500
§ Expected sales growth = 8% until 2022 and 0% thereafter.
§ Operating profit margin = 4% of sales.
§ Tax rate = 33%
§ Additional fixed capital = 17% of incremental sales.
§ Additional working capital = 4% of incremental sales.
§ Cost of capital (WACC) = 11%.
Valuation § Most used ratios
§ Equity Value
§ PER – P/E (Price Earnings Ratio)
§ Price/Book – Price Bool Value (Market - to - Book Value)
M&A
Multiples § Enterprise Value
§ Tobin’sq = Market value of firm/Replacement Cost = EV /
(Book Value of Equity + Book Value of Debt)
§ EV/EBIT(DA)
§ EV = Market Value of Equity + Market Value of (net) Debt
§ PER – P/E (Price Earnings Ratio)
§ PER = Share Price/EPS
Valuation
§ Application of the PER (or other ratio) model implies the
following steps:
§ 1. Examine the most recent and project the future
performance under the current target management
M&A § 2. Identify those elements of revenue and costs that will be
raised or lowered under the acquirer management Multiples
§ 3. Re - estimate the target’s future, post - acquisition earnings.
on a sustainable basis
§ 4. Select a benchmark PER (comparable companies in terms
of risk and growth)
§ 5. Multiply the sustainable earnings by the benchmark PER
to arrive at a value for equity.

§ Valuation of the target
§ P/E sector ratio – 12
§ Value based on earnings – 12 x 25 = 300
§ (+) Sell head office* – 70
§ (+) Sell of associated company* – 30 400
*Only sustainable earnings enter into the P/E model, elements
of a transitory nature are identified and valued separately
§ EV/EBITDA
§ Similar to PER model
§ Used heavily by analysts, in recent years, as an alternative
Valuation
measure of valuation
§ Allows the comparison between firms with different
capital structures
§ Main measure in leverage buy - out acquisitions since
M&A avoids the problem with the change of the target capital
Multiples structure after the acquisition
§ Equity = EV – Debt
§ Example
§ EV/EBITDA comparable firm ratio equal to 7
§ Valuation of the target
§ EV = 7 x 66 + 30 + 70 = $562m
§ Equity = 562 - 90 = $472m
